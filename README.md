# CatchMe Portfolio

Welcome to the **CatchMe Portfolio** project! This Flutter application showcases a fun and interactive way to present a portfolio. The main highlight of this project is the "Catch Me" feature, where a button playfully moves away when hovered over, making it an engaging experience for users.

## Features

- **Interactive Animation**: The "Catch Me" button moves to a random position nearby when hovered over, with increasing speed, making it challenging to catch.
- **Dynamic Background**: The background color changes randomly on each hover, adding a vibrant touch to the UI.
- **Profile Information**: Displays a welcoming message and profile details in a styled container.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout adjusts according to different screen sizes, ensuring a great user experience across devices.
